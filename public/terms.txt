################################################################################

1. Introduction
    These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
    services provided by Inferstat ("we", "us", "our") through
    inferstat.com and related platforms. By using our site or engaging
    our services you agree to these Terms.

2. Our Services
    We provide market research and data analytics services including
    social media analytics, survey data collection (online and physical),
    and insights for clients across FMCG, Banking, and related sectors.
    Descriptions of specific services, deliverables, timelines and fees
    will be set out in separate engagement letters, proposals or
    statements of work.

3. Data Collection & Privacy
    We collect and process data as described in our Privacy Policy. Data
    may come from social media platforms, surveys, or other sources. We
    take commercially reasonable measures to protect personal data, but
    you acknowledge that no system is completely secure.

4. Use of Third‑Party Data & Partners
    We may use third‑party data sources, tools and partners to deliver
    services. Where applicable, we rely on the terms and policies of
    those providers. References to partnerships (for example, with
    technology providers) do not create any direct contractual
    relationship between those third parties and you.

5. Intellectual Property
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing, we retain ownership of our
    methodologies, tools, models, code and know‑how. Clients receive a
    limited, non‑exclusive license to use deliverables for their internal
    business purposes only. You may not redistribute, resell or publish
    our work without prior written permission.

6. Client Responsibilities
    Clients must provide accurate, timely information and access required
    for project delivery. You are responsible for compliance with laws
    and regulations applicable to your use of the deliverables.

7. Fees & Payment
    Fees, payment terms and any expenses will be set out in the proposal
    or engagement document. Late payments may attract interest or
    suspension of services.

8. Limitation of Liability
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability for any claim
    arising out of or related to these Terms or our services is limited
    to the fees paid by you for the specific service giving rise to the
    claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special or
    consequential damages.

9. Indemnification
    You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from third‑party claims
    resulting from your use of our services or your violation of these
    Terms.

10. Termination
    Either party may terminate an engagement as specified in the
    applicable engagement document. Termination does not relieve you of
    obligations to pay fees for services performed prior to termination.

11. Changes to These Terms
    We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be
    communicated via our website or directly to clients where feasible.
    Continued use of our services after changes indicates acceptance.

12. Governing Law & Contact
    These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to our place of
    business unless otherwise specified in an engagement document.
